## What you have covered

You have learned that the execution time of a program can be influenced by your coding. In some instances we were able to accelerate our code without using additional resources through:

 * vectorisation
 * using numba
 * rewriting some parts in C++ 

 In other cases, we applied more resources to achieve higher performance:

 * using OpenMP
 * using MPI
